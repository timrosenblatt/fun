# Next thing to do is create a Composition, which seems like the most "get started here"
# feature of Crossplane. That seems to be the feature which allows me to create 
# a new public interface and do basic templating to create actual managed resources
# which will then be reconciled with the infra provider.

# There's a tutorial for Composition Revisions, which actually seems 
# like the best way to get started, since it covers Compositions and also a little 
# bit about the lifecycle of Compositions.
