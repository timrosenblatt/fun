Sadly the MNIST image database that the post links to is behind HTTP auth..seems to be the main one that a lot of tutorials use. Not sure if that's a temporary thing since it's so widely referenced, but I think <https://github.com/cvdfoundation/mnist> seems to be a solid mirror, so I'm going to try the tutorial with that.
